# i3indyatechnology
I attended a 2 day workshop hosted by i3indyatechnology which taught me how to use the i3indyatechnology MEGATron board with components such as Light Depended Resistor (LDR) Sensor, inbuilt buzzer and LEDs. Here I share the procedures to execute whatever was taught in it using Windows 10. The circuit used was ATMega16 which was provided the code using USBasp and USB TTL Receiver for serial communications.
