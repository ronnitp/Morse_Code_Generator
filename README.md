# Morse Code Generator
I attended a 2 day workshop as a part of the preliminary round hosted by i3indyatechnologies for qualifying for IoT Challenge - IIT Bombay Fest which taught me how to use the MEGATron v1.0 board with components such as Light Depended Resistor (LDR) Sensor, inbuilt buzzer and LEDs.
At the end of the workshop as a part of the elimination round my team built a Morse Code Generator.
This Morse Code Generator can generate Morse Code basaed on whatever is communicated via the Serial Communication Port.
Here I share the procedures to execute whatever was taught in it using Windows 10. 
The circuit used was ATMega16 which was provided the code using USBasp and USB TTL Receiver for serial communications.
The program to the board was uploaded using a USB TTL Receiver, the software used for uploading the code was Hercules.
In this repository every thing which me and my team did in the workshop has been uploaded and updated.
